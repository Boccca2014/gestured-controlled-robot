I completed this project in August 2017 at
BlueStamp Engineering over the course of 6 weeks.
Here is the link for more info:

I highly recommend this project if you're just 
learning about the combination of hardware and software
and want to have some fun as your project comes to life.

You can find me at https://sebastiancabrejos.com to
learn about what I'm doing these days.
